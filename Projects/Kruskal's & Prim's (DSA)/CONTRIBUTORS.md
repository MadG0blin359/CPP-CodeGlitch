# Kruskal's & Prim's Algorithms Project

## Overview

This project contains the efforts of Shawaiz Shahid on the "Kruskal's & Prim's" project. The purpose of this project is to Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) efficiently using kruskal and Prim Algorithms. These algorithms are fundamental in graph theory and are widely used for finding the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a graph.

## Project Details

- **GUI Status:** The Kruskal's & Prim's project is designed to run without a graphical user interface (GUI). It operates in a non-GUI environment, such as terminal or command prompt, focusing on simplicity and efficiency.

## Collaborator
-  The project is developed solely by **Shawaiz Shahid**.

## Project Details

- **Algorithms Covered**: 
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: A greedy algorithm that finds an MST by sorting edges by weight and adding them to the MST while avoiding cycles.
  - **Prim's Algorithm**: Another greedy approach that starts from a vertex and grows the MST by adding the smallest edge connected to the tree.
  
- **Objective**: 
  - To provide a hands-on demonstration of these algorithms for learning purposes.
  - To visualize and analyze their differences and performance.

- **Programming Language**: C++

- **Environment**: 
  - Designed to run in a non-GUI environment, such as a terminal or command prompt.

## Features

- **Input**: 
  - Graph representation using adjacency matrix.
  - User-defined number of vertices and edges.

- **Output**: 
  - Minimum Spanning Tree (list of edges and their weights).
  - Total cost of the MST.

- Optimized implementation with clear and modular code structure for educational purposes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **[Algorithms]:** This project implements two key Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms, Kruskal's and Prim's, to demonstrate graph traversal and edge selection techniques effectively.
- **`Source Files/`**: This folder contains all the source code files (`DSU.h`, `MST.h`, etc.).
- **`Executable/`**: The compiled executable file for running the application.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.

## How to Run
