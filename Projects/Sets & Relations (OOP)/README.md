# Project : Sets & Relations

## Overview

The **Sets & Relations** program is a command-line tool designed to perform operations on sets and analyze their relations. It allows users to create sets, perform various set operations, and determine properties of relations like reflexivity, symmetry, and anti-symmetry.

## Features

- **Set Creation**: Define two sets (`A` and `B`) with user-provided elements.

- **Set Operations**:
  - **Union (`A ∪ B`)**: Combines all unique elements of `A` and `B`.
  - **Intersection (`A ∩ B`)**: Identifies common elements between `A` and `B`.
  - **Set Difference (`A - B`, `B - A`)**: Computes the difference between the two sets.

- **Relation Properties**:
  - **Total Relations**: Calculates the total number of possible relations.
  - **Reflexive Relations**: Determines if the relation includes all self-pairs (e.g., `(a, a)`).
  - **Symmetric Relations**: Verifies if for every `(a, b)` in the relation, `(b, a)` also exists.
  - **Anti-Symmetric Relations**: Checks if for `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` in the relation, `a = b`.

- **Exit**: Allows you to exit the program gracefully.
